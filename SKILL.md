description: Rules and examples for adding Sentry metrics the right way. Covers how to name a counter, gauge, or duration metric; which tags are safe versus which will blow up your Sentry bill; how to track failures with a small fixed list of error types instead of raw exception strings; and how to add metrics around HTTP routes, external API calls, workflow steps, retry loops, and fallback paths without copy-pasting emit calls everywhere. Ships a CI check that blocks bad metrics before merge. Use this when someone asks to "instrument" code, "add a metric", "track duration", "count failures", "emit a counter/gauge/distribution", "add a span", "observe" a workflow step, or add a route, external API client, retry loop, or fallback path. Python reference examples included; the same shapes work in any language.

# Sentry Instrumentation

Sentry **system metrics** only (counter / gauge / distribution, duration, failure, resource). Product-analytics events (clicks, funnels, flag exposure) belong in your product-analytics tool — never in Sentry. Python under `examples/python/` is the canonical reference; other languages port the same shapes under idiomatic names.

Do not invoke for product-analytics changes. Stop and use the right tool.

## Decision rules

1. **New metric?** Read `references/signal-model.md` and pick a classmethod constructor (`MetricDef.counter|latency|gauge|resource|failure_counter`). Register in the project's metric registry. **Never** call an emission helper with a raw string or a dynamically-assembled name.
2. **Tag values?** Either enumerate them in `MetricDef.tag_constraints` or route through a bucket function from `references/tagging-and-cardinality.md`.
3. **Inside a loop?** Use `AggregatingCounter` or `DurationAccumulator` (see `references/cost-model.md`). If the metric's `loop_policy` is `"forbidden"` the CI gate refuses any emission inside a `for`/`while` body for that metric.
4. **New surface (HTTP route / external API / workflow step / retry / fallback)?** Use the matching reusable pattern from `references/surface-patterns.md`. Don't hand-roll the emissions.
5. **Changing a metric's meaning, unit, or tag shape?** It's a new versioned metric. See `references/naming-and-lifecycle.md`.
6. **Failure counter?** Build with `MetricDef.failure_counter(...)` and emit with `emit_failure(metric, failure=classify(exc), tags=...)`. Never pass `str(exc)` as a tag. See `references/failure-taxonomy.md`.

## Language detection

Detect the project language from manifest files, then extend any existing observability layer you find (`observability.py` / `observability.ts` / `metrics/` package). If none exists, scaffold from the matching example directory.

```
pyproject.toml / setup.py  → Python. Use examples/python/.
package.json               → TypeScript/JavaScript. Port from examples/python/ shapes.
go.mod                     → Go. Port from examples/python/ shapes.
Gemfile                    → Ruby. Port from examples/python/ shapes.
pom.xml / build.gradle     → Java/Kotlin. Port from examples/python/ shapes.
```

For ports: preserve the five constructors, the `FailureClass` taxonomy values, the 13 CI gate checks, and the emission-boundary rules. Names become idiomatic (`emit_counter` → `emitCounter`, `@instrumented_step` → `instrumentedStep(fn)`, etc.).

## Python project paths (canonical reference)

Replace `yourapp` with the project's package root on first use.

```
Emission module:    yourapp/observability.py
Registry:           yourapp/shared/metrics.py
Tag buckets:        yourapp/shared/metric_tags.py
Failure taxonomy:   yourapp/shared/failure_taxonomy.py
HTTP middleware:    yourapp/middleware/observability.py
Workflow decorator: yourapp/services/<workflow>/instrumentation.py
External API base:  yourapp/services/providers/instrumented_http_client.py
Retry helper:       yourapp/services/retry.py
Fallback helper:    yourapp/observability.py (or yourapp/shared/fallback.py)
CI gate:            scripts/check_metrics.py
```
